##About
Getting ready to finish up a 12 week program with the RockIT boot camp, I would love the opportunity to continue learning at a fast pace and help the team grow in Phoenix.

I’m looking to continue pushing my limits as a web developer by working with a company that empowers its nerds and encourages their growth by letting them leave their comfort zone.

Currently my relative strengths are in JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and soft-skills.  While my technical skills aren’t where I would like them to be, my drive in a supportive environment will ensure that I can provide value quickly.

There’s tons more to learn but through the boot camp I’ve proven I can learn quickly and apply that knowledge.  Having talked with several employees from The Nerdery and doing some research, I don’t think there’s a better place to achieve this goal than The Nerdery.
